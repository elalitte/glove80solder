# Glove80 soldered or not soldered, that is the question

## Why would I like to solder the switches when there is already a soldered version ?
I've been looking for a while for the right keyboard for me.

After some tests and searches I found that the MoErgo Glove80 would be the best choice for me.

Then I had to chose between the switches flavors offered.

The proposed defaults are the usual linear, clicky, tactile choice which are fine, but I was wondering if I could get a better choice for me with more specific choc switches.

After some readings and tests, I felt for the sunset clicky switches which I prefered from the classic brown version.

But at that time I wasn't sure I would be able to get the unsoldered version of the glove80 and solder my sunrise switches without damaging the whole thing.

As long as I'm a true adventurer, I chose the risky unsoldered version of the keyboard (I read a bit before about the persons who also did that choice and seemed to get well with it)
## Receiving the keyboard and try not to mess with it
I received the keyboard last week (and was sooooo happy)
It took me 2 to 3 hours to get it up and ready with my new sunset switches soldered.
The keyboard arrives with default red linear switches in place, but they are not soldered.

They are different tasks you will have to do to get it up and running :
1. Unscrew the palm rests and take them away from the keyboard
2. Unscrew all the screws from the left and right parts
3. Carefully open the parts not to break the FCC cables
4. Open and pull off the FCC cables
5. Pull the keycaps off
6. Pull the switches off
7. Put the new switches on
8. Solder the switches
9. Put the FCC cables back in
10. Close the parts and screw it back
11. Put the keycaps back on
12. Enjoy !

But those steps are not that simple and a few precautions should be taken for them to be done in a good way.

### Unscrew the palm rests
Easy muffin, you can do it manually but if the screw is too tied youcan use a screwdriver (I had to use it for two of the screws)

When it's done, it's easy to take the palm rests appart
### Unscrew all the screws from the left and right parts
### Open the parts
### Pull the keycaps off
You will have to pull the keycaps with a keycap puller.
As long as the red original switches are not soldered, they might come with the keycap when you are trying to pull it.
It's not a problem at all, but you should pay attention to it for a good reason.
They are 4 distinct PCBs on the glove 80 which are bent to fit the curved shape of the keyboard.
